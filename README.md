# MRInoiseBiasCorrection
This repository contains simple Matlab / Octave code to correct the noise induced bias in (root) sum-of-square reconstructed MR magnitude images.

Contains:

- correctNoiseBias.m        : the core function you might want to include in your project
- createLookupTable.m       : a script to create new lookup tables if the desired number of coil elements is not provided by default
- noiseBiasLookupTable.mat  : lookup tables for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 channel coils
- testNoiseBiasCorrection.m : a short script to test the correction and show its effect on the measured mean signal intensity

See commentary in functions for details and references.
